# Office-Man
C# WinForms game.
This is a simple game developing on C# specifically on Win Forms.
The essence of the game is in getting as much points as you can
while falling down of the main characters office building by
hitting birds or stuff.
By those points you can buy some goods and take them with you on
the next run (for example parachute or portal gun).
